    "### Sudoku Notation and Preliminary Notions\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to agree on some notation. A Sudoku puzzle is a grid of 81 squares; the majority of enthusiasts label the columns 1-9, the rows A-I, and call a collection of nine squares (column, row, or box) a unit and the squares that share a unit the peers. A puzzle leaves some squares blank and fills others with digits, and the whole idea is:\n",
    "A puzzle is solved if the squares in each unit are filled with a permutation of the digits 1 to 9.\n",
    "That is, no digit can appear twice in a unit, and every digit must appear once. This implies that each square must have a different value from any of its peers. Here are the names of the squares, a typical puzzle, and the solution to the puzzle:\n",

Second, an internal representation of any state of a puzzle, partially solved or complete; this we will call a values collection because it will give all the remaining possible values for each square. For the textual format (grid) we'll allow a string of characters with 1-9 indicating a digit, and a 0 or period specifying an empty square. All other characters are ignored (including spaces, newlines, dashes, and bars). So each of the following three grid strings represent the same puzzle:\n",

    "Now for values. One might think that a 9 x 9 array would be the obvious data structure. But squares have names like 'A1', not (0,0). Therefore, values will be a dict with squares as keys. The value of each key will be the possible digits for that square: a single digit if it was given as part of the puzzle definition or if we have figured out what it must be, and a collection of several digits if we are still uncertain. This collection of digits could be represented by a Python set or list, but I chose instead to use a string of digits (we'll see why later). So a grid where A1 is 7 and C7 is empty would be represented as {'A1': '7', 'C7': '123456789', ...}."

    "The function parse_grid calls assign(values, s, d). We could implement this as values[s] = d, but we can do more than just that. Those with experience solving Sudoku puzzles know that there are two important strategies that we can use to make progress towards filling in all the squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) If a square has only one possible value, then eliminate that value from the square's peers. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) If a unit has only one possible place for a value, then put the value there.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of strategy (1) if we assign 7 to A1, yielding {'A1': '7', 'A2':'123456789', ...}, we see that A1 has only one value, and thus the 7 can be removed from its peer A2 (and all other peers), giving us {'A1': '7', 'A2': '12345689', ...}. As an example of strategy (2), if it turns out that none of A3 through A9 has a 3 as a possible value, then the 3 must belong in A2, and we can update to {'A1': '7', 'A2':'3', ...}. These updates to A2 may in turn cause further updates to its peers, and the peers of those peers, and so on. This process is called constraint propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function assign(values, s, d) will return the updated values (including the updates from constraint propagation), but if there is a contradiction--if the assignment cannot be made consistently--then assign returns False. For example, if a grid starts with the digits '77...' then when we try to assign the 7 to A2, assign would notice that 7 is not a possibility for A2, because it was eliminated by the peer, A1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the fundamental operation is not assigning a value, but rather eliminating one of the possible values for a square, which we implement with eliminate(values, s, d). Once we have eliminate, then assign(values, s, d) can be defined as \"eliminate all the values from s except d\"."
